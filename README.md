## üîç What is Generative Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate from expected patterns. Generative AI, including autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, and foundation models, offers powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions. By learning to reconstruct, represent, or estimate the likelihood of normal data, these models enable the detection of subtle and high‚Äëdimensional anomalies across diverse modalities such as images, videos, time series, and logs.

Generative approaches not only improve detection accuracy but also facilitate interpretability (e.g., anomaly localization) and complementary tasks such as anomaly synthesis and restoration, making them a promising direction for next‚Äëgeneration anomaly detection systems.
