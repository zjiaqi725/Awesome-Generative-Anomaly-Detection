## üîç What is Generative Anomaly Detection?

Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate from expected patterns. Generative AI, including autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, and foundation models, offers powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions. By learning to reconstruct, represent, or estimate the likelihood of normal data, these models enable the detection of subtle and high‚Äëdimensional anomalies across diverse modalities such as images, videos, time series, and logs.

Generative approaches not only improve detection accuracy but also facilitate interpretability (e.g., anomaly localization) and complementary tasks such as anomaly synthesis and restoration, making them a promising direction for next‚Äëgeneration anomaly detection systems.

## 1 Generative Anomaly Detection Methods

### 1.1 Reconstruction-driven Methods

Reconstruction-driven approaches have emerged as a mainstream paradigm in generative anomaly detection, with demonstrated success across diverse data modalities.
The core idea of reconstruction-based anomaly detection is to train a generative model to capture the underlying normal data distribution and reconstruct in-distribution instances well.
Anomalies are then detected by measuring the reconstruction error, i.e., the difference between the input and its reconstruction, under the assumption that abnormal samples cannot be precisely reconstructed due to their deviation from learned normal patterns.

The rise of foundation models, notably LLMs and MLLMs, marks a paradigm shift in AI, delivering unprecedentedly powerful and versatile representation learning capabilities.
Next, we review the representation-driven anomaly detection approaches based on various foundation model types.

### 1.3 Density Estimation-driven Approaches

Unlike reconstruction-driven methods that identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors, or representation-driven methods that assess deviations within learned embeddings, density estimation-driven approaches rely on the likelihood or probability density as their core anomaly-scoring metric.
The central premise behind density estimation-driven anomaly detection is intuitive and robust: anomalies are inherently associated with low-density regions within the learned data manifold.

## 2 Complementary Generative Tasks

Anomaly synthesis and anomaly restoration have emerged as two closely related tasks that extend the scope of generative modeling in anomaly detection.
Anomaly synthesis focuses on creating realistic abnormal instances, enabling data augmentation for training, stress-testing detection models, and constructing more comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.
Anomaly restoration aims to recover anomalous inputs back to their plausible normal states, supporting interpretability, diagnostics, and even operational restoration in domains such as medical and industrial inspection.
